# Challenges

Coding challenge solutions

# Running Solutions
You will be able to find detailed instructions on how to run each solution
in the languages directory README.md. If a particular solution requires
something else to run or is run in a different manner, the details will be
displayed within the solution file itself.

# Languages
At the moment I am solving the problems with:

- JavaScript

In time, I will solve these problems in various other languages.

# Challenge Sites
A short list of the sites I use for the challenges:

- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)
- [CoderByte](https://www.coderbyte.com)

In time there will be more challenge sites being added here.

# Stats
I include a basic time to execution in each solution file as a basic bench
mark. This is probably dependent on my system and you probably shouldn't 
take these stats too seriously. ;)
